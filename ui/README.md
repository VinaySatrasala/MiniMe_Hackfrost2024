The tournament has witnessed legendary performances, unforgettable moments, and intense rivalries since its inception in 1975.

### Host Country: India

The 2023 Cricket World Cup will be hosted by India, a nation where cricket is not just a sport but a religion. India previously co-hosted the World Cup in 1987, 1996, and 2011. This time, India will be the sole host, promising a festival of cricket with its passionate fans, vibrant culture, and world-class stadiums. Notable venues include the iconic Eden Gardens in Kolkata, Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, and the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, which is the largest cricket stadium in the world.

### Tournament Format and Schedule

The 2023 edition follows a similar format to the 2019 Cricket World Cup. Ten teams will compete in a round-robin format, where each team plays the other nine teams. The top four teams will then advance to the semifinals, followed by the grand finale. This format ensures that every match holds significance, keeping fans on the edge of their seats throughout the tournament.

The World Cup is scheduled to take place from October to November 2023, promising pleasant weather conditions for both players and spectators. The exact dates and fixtures will be announced by the ICC closer to the event.
